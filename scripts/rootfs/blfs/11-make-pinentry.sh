# 11. pinentry
# The PIN-Entry package contains a collection of simple PIN or pass-phrase entry 
# dialogs which utilize the Assuan protocol as described by the Ã„gypten project. 
# PIN-Entry programs are usually invoked by the gpg-agent daemon, but can be run
# from the command line as well. There are programs for various text-based and GUI
# environments, including interfaces designed for Ncurses (text-based), and for
# the common GTK and Qt toolkits.
# required: libassuan,libgpg-error
# optional: emacs,fltk,gcr,gtk+,libsecret,qt5,efl
