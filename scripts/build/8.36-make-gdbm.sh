# 8.36. GDBM
# The GDBM package contains the GNU Database Manager.
# It is a library of database functions that use extensible hashing and works
# similar to the standard UNIX dbm. The library provides primitives for storing
# key/data pairs, searching and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a
# key along with its data.
