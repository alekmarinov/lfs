# 4. make-ca
# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a method to validate the authenticity of 
# an otherwise unknown entity across untrusted networks. PKI works by establishing
# a chain of trust, rather than trusting each individual host or entity explicitly.
# In order for a certificate presented by a remote entity to be trusted, that certificate 
# must present a complete chain of certificates that can be validated using the root 
# certificate of a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by the local machine.
# required: p11-kit
# optional: nss
